## Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Guille.

### I'm finishing a degree in Business and Statisctics in the UC3M. When I gradute I am going to apply to a Masters degree in Sports Big Data. My goal is to make an impact with my data analyses in each position that I'm hired for.âš¡

### Right now I'm focused on a couple of courses. I've finished the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and I've started recently the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp in Udemy. After those two, I will take a break from data and completing the Google Project Management Professional Certificate.ðŸŒ±

### Here I will be posting the projects I've been doing at uni, so most of my work will be in Spanish.ðŸ“• I hope they help some of you!
